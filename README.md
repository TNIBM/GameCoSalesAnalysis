# GameCoSalesAnalysis

## Objective
GameCo is an online video game company that wants to use data to inform the development of new games. As such, performed a descriptive analysis of a video game data set to foster a
better understanding of how GameCo’s new games might fare in the market.

## Key Questions
GameCo executives are open to hearing any insights you can pull from the data but
are specically interested in these questions:

● Are certain types of games more popular than others?

● What other publishers will likely be the main competitors in certain markets?

● Have any games decreased or increased in popularity over time?

● How have their sales gures varied between geographic regions over time?

## Data Set

The data set covers historical sales of video games (for games that sold more than 10,000 copies) spanning different
platforms, genres, and publishing studios. This data was drawn from the website VGChartz.

Following important points regarding the data set:

● It tracks the total number of units of games sold (not nancial gures) from
1980 to 2016.

● The numbers represent units sold in millions. When you see the number “1.2,”
for instance, this represents a total of 1.2 million units sold.
